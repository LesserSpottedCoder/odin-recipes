    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Cranachan might be a new one on many but it's a firm Scottish favourite, and has been for many years - nothing to do with the inclusion of whisky! If you haven't come across it before it can look very different depending on where you are and how liberal your host is with a bottle! Generally, it is an individual serving of a layered dessert - fruity, sweet, and ever so slightly boozy. A wonderful finisher for a Christmas dinner. </p>

    <p>Often, instead of being presented in layers, cranachan wil instead be mixed together. This deviation in presentation results in an ever so slightly different taste and texture, adding to the charm of the dessert. The gorgeous simplicity of it begs to be played with, easily accommodating a whole host of different twists - citrus, chocolate, seasonal fruits etc.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp oatmeal</li>
        <li>300g seasonal fruit/s of choice</li>
        <li>sprinkle of caster/brown sugar</li>
        <li>350g double cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp heather honey</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp whisky, more or less as preferred</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Toast the oatmeal gently by spreading out in an even layer on a baking sheet and grilling until it smells nutty. Cool once toasted.</li>
        <li>Make a fruit puree by crushing half the fuit and sieving, sweetening to taste with a little sugar. Alternatively, slightly crush the fruit but leave it largely whole.</li>
        <li>Whisk the double cream (taking care not to over whisk) then add in the honey and whisky to taste.</li>
        <li>Stir the oatmeal into the cream mixture and whisk lightly until mixture is slightly firm.</li>
        <li>At this point, either alternate layers of cream mix with puree/fruit in a small dish <strong>or</strong> mix everything together, Eton mess style.</li>
        <li>Top with a little fruit, a pinch of sugar and a swirl of honey.</li>
        <li>Allow to chill slightly before eating.</li>
    </ol>
