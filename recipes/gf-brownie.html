    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Everyone loves a chocolate brownie, whether it's gooey and melting or crumbly and rich, each to their own. Now there are some <em>wonderful</em> gluten free recipes available too
        so even those with intollerances can enjoy a chocolate fix.</p>

    <p>Brownies are a fantastic 'base' dessert - you can add in anything you like. Pecans and cinnamon, banana, spices, peanut butter, caramel, wherever your taste buds take you!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>100g gluten-free plain flour</li>
        <li>50g cocoa powder</li>
        <li>250g butter</li>
        <li>250g chocolate - a mix of dark and milk gives a great result </li>
        <li>4 medium eggs</li>
        <li>280g caster sugar</li>
        <li>180g chocolate chips</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 160C Fan / 180C and prepare a 9x9inch square tin with non-stick baking paper.</li>
        <li>Melt together your butter and chocolate in a microwave or over a bain marie until completely melted. Mix together and leave out to cool down to just warm / room temp.</li>
        <li>Sieve together your cocoa powder and gluten free flour in a bowl. Mix briefly until combined, put to one side.</li>
        <li>In another bowl crack 4 medium eggs (or 3 large eggs) and pour in your caster sugar. Beat together (I use an electric hand whisk) until paler in colour and almost a little frothy.</li>
        <li>Once the chocolate and butter mixture is cooled to room temp, pour it into your egg/sugar mixture. Fold it in with a spatula - it will initially marble and then turn super chocolatey.</li>
        <li>Next fold in the your gluten free plain flour and cocoa powder mix. Ensure it's fully folded in.</li>
        <li>Fold in your chocolate chips, if using.</li>
        <li>Pour/spoon your brownie mixture into your prepared tin and smooth it over so it's even and level.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 35-40 minutes. The brownies will wobble slightly upon removing from the oven but will firm up as they cool. If you want them even more gooey, cook for 5 minutes less, if you want a firmer brownie, cook for slightly longer. I find with brownies all ovens seem to really vary.</li>
        <li>Its really important to allow your brownies to cool completely before removing from the tin and slicing them. I find they firm up even more after slicing.</li>
        <li>Serve as a treat at room temperature or warm with some ice cream as dessert. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
